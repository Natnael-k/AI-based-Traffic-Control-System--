# AI-based-Traffic-Control-System
Computer vision aided traffic scheduling systems



AI-based-Traffic-Control-System is an inteligent embedded system which applies computer vision to determine the density of cars at each lane on a traffic intersection so as to generate adaptive duration for green and red traffic light at each lane. 

This repository represents an ongoing open source research into utilizing different object detection algorithims like YOLO  to design an inteligent traffic control system. All the code and models are under research and development and subject to change.

## Devices Used
